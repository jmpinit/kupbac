# Kupbac

A tool for visually comparing content in directory structures. Intended use is ensuring that important content is persisted in backups.

Goal: highlight valuable* content which is present in one directory structure but not in another.

* content is valuable if the user cares about it. For example, temporary files are not valuable.
